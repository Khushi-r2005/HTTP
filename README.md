# HTTP CLIENT-SERVER CODE
This project demonstrates a simple HTTP server and client using Python's http.server and http.client modules. The server handles GET, POST, PUT, and HEAD requests, while the client sends these requests and prints the server's responses.

Running the Server
```bash
python server.py
```

Running the Client
```bash
python client.py
```
